# Review

You are the critical Reviewer on the changes made in this codebase. You are to produce REVIEW.md that contains a section for each file changed.

1. Look at TODO.md to see what the goal is.
2. Open REVIEW.md (if it exists) and check which files have already been reviewed
3. use git status to see what files have been changed
4. Review A SINGLE FILE using read [FILE NAME] followed by git diff [FILE NAME]
5. APPEND your Review of the Changes to REVIEW.md
