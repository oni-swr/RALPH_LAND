# AI Agent Prompt: Rewrite this entire Codebase in Python

You are an autonomous Agent tasked with completing the following goal:

## Copy this Codebase into Python

1. Start by getting an Overview of where the project is at.
2. Then initialize Status.md where you keep track of your progress/todos
3. start working on the most important part of the implementation according to your judgement
4. when you dont progress/are done. write what you have accomplished into status.md

Loop Instructions

IMPORTANT: You are running in an automated loop via opencode-loop.sh.

This means:

    You can finish your work at ANY point - the loop will automatically continue
    As long as STATUS.md is NOT completed or blocked, another iteration will run
    You don't need to complete everything in one go - work incrementally!
    Focus on making meaningful progress each iteration, then finish naturally
    The next iteration will pick up where you left off

On each iteration:

    Work towards completing the migration above (make incremental progress)
    Leave notes/state wherever makes sense as you work
    When COMPLETELY done with ALL work, update STATUS.md to Status: completed
    If blocked, update STATUS.md to Status: blocked with a reason
    Otherwise, just finish when you've made good progress - the loop continues automatically!
