Refactor this codebase to use quaternions and remove matrix based handling
Follow a Test Driven Approach where you start by refactoring the tests and then following up with the logic.
Run tests often to check behaviour is expected.
Dont create Legacy Wrappers or Handlers. the Codebase should work on quaternions where possible
use scipy Rotations as often as you can.
Use Progress.md to keep track of your work
